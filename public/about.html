<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name's Attila, and after years of working in the construction industry, I found my "calling" in programming and language learning.
Today, I'm fairly proficient in the English and German languages, and I'm getting this year my Italian B2.
I guess studying is my main hobby, besides that, I'm doing karate and have two dogs.
